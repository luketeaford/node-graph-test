<h1>Audio/Control Signal Test</h1>
<p>This is a reduced test case of the FM (cross-modulation) in <a href="http://tanguysynth.com">TANGUY</a>.</p>
<p>In Firefox, there is no sound when FM is connected -- even if gain is changed in the DevTools. In Chrome, the FM doesn't seem to have an effect (unlike in TANGUY).</p>
